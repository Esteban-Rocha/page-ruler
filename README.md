# So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish

Due to work and family commitments I have not had the time these past few years to maintain Page Ruler so
have made the hard decision to transfer ownership to another person in the hope that it can be given a new
lease of life instead of stagnating forever.
 
I'd like to say thank you to everyone who installed the extension and especially to those who contributed
new features, bug fixes and translations.
It was amazing to see something I made grow to a user base of nearly 750,000 users and I look forward to seeing that rise even more in the future. 

Original source code can still be found on the [original_source_code](https://github.com/wrakky/page-ruler/tree/original_source_code) branch.
